New York imposes a mortgage tax on real estate transactions. This tax rate in NYC is 1.8% on mortgage amounts less than $500,000 and 1.95% on mortgages over $500,000. When buying a home, there is no sales tax, but you are taxed on the mortgage amount. The is only a sales tax on homes over $1,000,000 and this amount is only 1%, less than the rate for a struggling family borrowing money to purchase a modest home.
This means that a person buying a $500,000 home for cash pays no tax, a person buying the same home and putting 20% down, (or borrowing $400,000) pays $7,200 in mortgage tax, and a person who only has a 3% down payment on the same purchase must pay $8,730 in additional closing costs to cover this tax.  

We have two hypotheses that we will explore in this project:

•	We believe that this is an unfair policy that has a disparate impact on people who are already economically disadvantaged.

•	We also believe that if this tax was lowered and applied across the board to all home purchases, based on sales price not mortgage amount, the policy would not only be more fair but raise more revenue for the government.
We are going to analyze the sales data of 15,550 homes sold in Brooklyn, NY in 2022. We will use this data to calculate how much mortgage tax was raised and how much would be raised if it was a sales tax that was only 2/3s of the current mortgage tax rate and if the Mansion tax was only an additional 0.5% instead of the current 1% (since those purchasing homes over a million dollars would now also be paying the standard sales tax).
We will also use census data to examine the differences in demographics of the different zip codes to see if people with lower incomes are paying a large portion of this tax than people living in zip codes with higher average incomes.
